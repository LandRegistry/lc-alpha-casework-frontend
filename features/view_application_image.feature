Feature: View Application Image

As a land charges caserworker
I want to be able to view an image on a bankruptsy application form
So that I can ensure that details are captured correctly onto the land charges register

Scenario: Using the land charges system
Given I am on the view application screen
When I have selected to view specific the application list
When the image of the application is displayed I can click on all available pages
When I am on a page I can zoom out
Then I am on a page I can zoom in
